Curie is a cute desk companion robot. Its physical body consists of 3 servos to give it 3 dof, 2 touch capacitive touch sensors which allow you to pet it, and an oled screen to display its cute eyes.
My goal is to be able to speak to Curie through AI, preferably trough an api key and not locally as i want it to have access to the internet.
I want her to have "mood settings" so that i can choose Curie's mood to match mine. Sometimes you just need a study buddy, so all you gotta say is "Curie, study mode." She will then switch to said mode and unlock a set of features, like pomodoro in this case. Another funny mode could be the "Talking Curie mode" where it behaves much like Talking Ben, replying only with yes/no/laugh/etc randomly.These are only a few of the moods that i have in mind that i would like to implement.
Apart from this i want Curie to be highly customizable, perhaps through an app. For example, i want Curie to be able to reference memes that are popular and trending at this time freely based on the "Humor Setting" set by the user. 
This is a long term project and i will keep adding features to her as i get new ideas.
